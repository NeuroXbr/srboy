<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Super boy application, establishing a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB. A key initial focus was on implementing a merit + proximity matching system and fair pricing, adhering to the user's ethical vision. After successfully building and testing this initial MVP, the project underwent a significant redefinition. The user provided a comprehensive new production command, renaming the app to SrBoy, revamping business logic (e.g., pricing, wait fees), and outlining a future cloud-agnostic microservices architecture. The AI engineer effectively re-branded and re-implemented the core functionalities for SrBoy v2.0, including detailed multi-step registration forms for motoboys and lojistas. Currently, the AI engineer is in the process of integrating advanced security, optimization, and fraud prevention algorithms as per the latest user request, demonstrating adaptability to major scope changes and iterative development.

The project is to develop SrBoy, a regional delivery application. It features mobile apps (React Native) for motoboys and lojistas, and web panels for lojistas and administrators. The initial MVP focused on a merit-based motoboy ranking and a non-predatory pricing model.

**Monetization & Pricing:**
*   Base fare: R0.00, covering up to 4km.
*   Per km rate: R.00/km thereafter.
*   Platform fee: Fixed R.00 per delivery, deducted from the motoboy's earnings.
*   Motoboy earnings (over 4km): R.00 + R.00/km (platform passes full amount).
*   Customer wait time: 10 minutes free, then R.00/minute after the 11th minute.
*   Onboarding: Free for motoboys and lojistas; platform monetizes solely via delivery fees.

**Core Functionalities:**
*   **User Types:** Motoboys, Lojistas (merchants), and Administrators (Naldino).
*   **Matching System:** Prioritizes motoboys based on a transparent ranking (merit and discipline) and proximity, not a bidding system.
*   **Registration:** Multi-step forms for motoboys (personal info, moto details, document upload, bank details) and lojistas (store info, address, operating hours, logo upload). Includes validation for CNH (OCR), device tracking (IMEI, MAC, Android ID) for security, and cross-data validation.
*   **Payment Flow:** Lojistas load credits via Mercado Pago/Stripe wallet. Motoboys receive daily PIX payments (net of platform fee).
*   **Delivery Workflow:** Digital delivery receipt with dual checkout (store confirms pickup, customer confirms delivery). Client Not Found flow with wait time charges and potential partial/full refund.
*   **Information Exchange:** Lojistas receive motoboy details (name, moto color/model/plate); Motoboys receive customer details (name, ID, authorized third party).
*   **Geolocalization:** Dynamic routing considering real-time traffic, demand prediction (heat maps).
*   **Community & Support:** City-based chat rooms with moderation, emergency button for operational issues.
*   **Security & Fraud Prevention:** ML-based risk analysis (carousel patterns, abnormal speed, unusual action times), real-time identity validation (facial verification), cross-data analysis for consistency, data collection solely for security/fraud prevention.

**Current Implementation Status:** The core SrBoy v2.0 including the rebranded landing page, new pricing logic, wait-time system, digital receipt preparation, and comprehensive multi-step registration pages for motoboy and lojista are implemented and visually confirmed.

<code_architecture>

**High-Level Architecture:**
The application is currently structured as a monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. Data persistence is handled by MongoDB for the implemented features. Future plans indicate a shift towards a microservices architecture using Node.js/Python, PostgreSQL, and Redis, deployed on GCP or Azure.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This is the core of the FastAPI backend, handling all API routes ( prefix), business logic, database interactions, and user management. It defines endpoints for user authentication, delivery creation, matching, and status updates.
    *   **Changes Made:** Initially set up for Super boy with base matching logic. It was heavily rewritten to implement SrBoy v2.0 changes: rebranding, new pricing logic (R0 base, R/km), the R.00/min wait-time system, expanded delivery statuses (e.g., ), and digital receipt data handling. It has been recently modified to include imports for security algorithms.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** The main React component that renders the entire user interface. It contains the logic for displaying the landing page, switching between user dashboards (Lojista/Motoboy), and handling user interactions.
    *   **Changes Made:** Initially provided a basic functional UI for Super boy. It was significantly rewritten for SrBoy v2.0 to reflect the new branding, updated pricing displays, and the new wait-time feature. Most recently, it was extended to include the comprehensive multi-step registration forms for both Motoboy and Lojista, utilizing Shadcn UI components for a modern look.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Contains component-specific CSS that, along with  and , defines the application's visual style.
    *   **Changes Made:** Adjusted to align with the SrBoy rebrand and design principles, incorporating gradients and specific color schemes for the new registration pages.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    *   **Changes Made:**  was added to resolve an import error, ensuring location-based calculations could function.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** A newly created file intended to house the implementation of advanced security features, such as the machine learning-based behavioral risk analysis and real-time identity validation.
    *   **Changes Made:** Created in the most recent iteration to begin implementing the user's detailed security requirements.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** A newly created file specifically for the logic related to the machine learning model for analyzing motoboy behavior and assigning risk scores.
