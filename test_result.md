# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The condition 'if delivery.get(\"pin_confirmacao\") and delivery.get(\"pin_tentativas\", 0) == 0' is backwards - it only checks PIN validation when pin_tentativas is 0, but after incorrect attempts pin_tentativas > 0, so the check is bypassed. This allows delivery finalization without proper PIN validation, which is a security vulnerability."

The logic now uses pin_validado_com_sucesso field to track successful PIN validation instead of relying on pin_tentativas == 0. Delivery finalization is properly blocked with error message 'PIN de confirmação deve ser validado antes de finalizar a entrega. Use o endpoint /validate-pin primeiro.' until PIN is successfully validated. Security vulnerability resolved."

          comment: "Mixed results: GET /api/security/analyze/{motoboy_id} returns 500 error (server issue), but GET /api/demand/predict/{city} works, POST /api/chat/moderate works with profanity filtering, POST /api/routes/optimize requires motoboy location but functions correctly after location update. Admin authorization working correctly (403 for non-admin users)."

          comment: "FIXED! Security analysis endpoint now working correctly. GET /api/security/analyze/{motoboy_id} returns comprehensive analysis with risk_analysis (risk_score: 0.0, risk_level: 'low', risk_factors array, recommended_actions), data_consistency check, and overall_security_score: 100.0. Admin authentication working properly (403 for non-admin). All other security endpoints confirmed working: demand prediction, route optimization (with location update), and chat moderation with profanity filtering."

      message: "Please test the new PIN confirmation system that was just implemented in SrBoy. Need to test PIN generation, validation, blocking after 3 attempts, delivery finalization requiring PIN validation, and data structure verification."
    - agent: "testing"
      message: "PIN system testing completed. MIXED RESULTS: 5/8 tests passed (62.5% success rate). ✅ WORKING: PIN generation (8-digit alphanumeric with 4-digit confirmation), PIN validation endpoint (correct/incorrect attempts, attempt counting), PIN blocking after 3 attempts, PIN data structure verification. ❌ CRITICAL BUGS FOUND: 1) PIN validation logic in delivery finalization is flawed - allows finalization without proper PIN validation (security vulnerability), 2) Receipt creation fails when skipping proper delivery status flow (pickup_confirmed -> in_transit -> delivered). The PIN generation and validation mechanisms work correctly, but the integration with delivery finalization has serious bugs that need immediate fixing."

      message: "Por favor, teste novamente o sistema de PIN corrigido. Acabei de corrigir os bugs críticos identificados no teste anterior: 1) Lógica de Validação Corrigida - agora uso campo específico pin_validado_com_sucesso para rastrear quando PIN foi validado corretamente, 2) Tratamento de Recibo Melhorado - adicionei tratamento gracioso para timestamps ausentes na criação do recibo, 3) Campo Adicional - agora rastreamos pin_validado_em com timestamp da validação bem-sucedida. Execute o teste completo novamente e confirme se os bugs críticos foram resolvidos."
    - agent: "testing"
      message: "🎉 PIN SYSTEM CORRECTIONS VERIFIED! All critical bugs have been successfully fixed. COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS: ✅ ALL 8 PIN TESTS PASSED (100% success rate). CRITICAL FIXES CONFIRMED: 1) ✅ Delivery finalization security - now properly blocked until PIN validation using pin_validado_com_sucesso field, 2) ✅ Receipt creation - handles missing timestamps gracefully, 3) ✅ New tracking fields - pin_validado_com_sucesso and pin_validado_em working correctly. COMPLETE PIN SYSTEM VERIFICATION: PIN generation (8-digit alphanumeric), PIN validation (correct/incorrect attempts), PIN blocking (after 3 attempts), delivery finalization security, PIN data structure, and delivery status flow - ALL WORKING PERFECTLY. The PIN system is now secure and fully functional."
